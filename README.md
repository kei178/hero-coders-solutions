## Requirements

### Coding challenge:

You can email the solution in a separate message after addressing the questions above.

1. Write a function that determines the area of a circle given the radius.
1. Write a function that determines if a string starts with an upper-case letter A-Z and returns true or false.

#### Important:

- Source code of programming tasks should be in pure JavaScript (no HTML, CSS, etc.).
- Each task should be implemented as a separate function. Imagine you’re writing a library function for other developers.
- The quality of the solution should be “production” like.
- Tests, even as simple as using console.log, are very welcome.
- Please send the source code as a link to GitHub, JSbin, or any other service of your choice.
